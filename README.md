# Protecting-Women-from-Safety-Threats-Using-Computer-Vision

## Problem Statement-
This project aims to address the issue of women's safety in urban environments by utilizing advanced deep learning and computer vision models to detect potential safety threats in real-time. The solution leverages CCTV footage to detect and analyze safety threats such as violence, the presence of multiple men near a lone woman, suspicious activity, and more, ensuring timely alerts for prevention and intervention.

## SIH Hackathon-
This project was initiated as part of the Smart India Hackathon (SIH), where the focus was on developing technology-driven solutions for womenâ€™s safety. The proposed solution aims to improve real-time threat detection using AI and alert systems integrated into a CCTV framework.
